Credit Card Fraud Detection using LSTM
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning model (LSTM) to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset.
The dataset is highly imbalanced (fraud cases are rare compared to legitimate ones). To handle this, we use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the classes before training.

⚙️ Steps Implemented
1. Import Libraries

Pandas, NumPy → Data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn → Data visualization

Scikit-learn → Preprocessing, train-test split, evaluation metrics

Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE) → Handle class imbalance

TensorFlow/Keras → LSTM-based deep learning model

2. Load Dataset

Load dataset creditcard.csv

Check dataset info, head, tail, missing values

3. Class Distribution Check

Fraudulent vs Legitimate transactions distribution

Visualized using count plots

4. Handle Class Imbalance

Applied SMOTE to oversample minority class (fraud transactions)

Verified balanced dataset visually

5. Data Preprocessing

Split dataset into train/test (80-20 split)

Standardized features using StandardScaler

Reshaped input data for LSTM compatibility

6. Model Architecture (LSTM)

LSTM Layer (64 units) with return_sequences=True

Dropout (0.2) to prevent overfitting

LSTM Layer (32 units)

Dense Layer (16, ReLU activation)

Output Layer (Sigmoid activation)

7. Model Training

Optimizer: Adam

Loss: Binary Crossentropy

Metrics: Accuracy

Trained for 10 epochs with batch size 64

8. Model Evaluation

📌 Notes

Dataset: Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection

Data is highly imbalanced; hence SMOTE is crucial.

LSTM is chosen due to sequential pattern detection ability, though fraud detection can also be solved with Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
